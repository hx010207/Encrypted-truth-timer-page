Encrypted Truth Countdown Timer
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Overview
Encrypted Truth is a custom, full-screen interactive countdown timer built specifically to serve as the dramatic centerpiece for a murder mystery event. Designed for large-screen projection, the application combines a dark, atmospheric aesthetic with precise, reliable functionality to build suspense throughout the event.

‚ú® Key Features
üé® Visuals and Aesthetics
Thematic Background: Utilizes a custom-designed, high-resolution image that frames the timer with murder mystery-themed elements at the top and bottom, ensuring the central area remains perfectly clear for maximum visibility.

Branding Integration: Features two specific logo images placed discreetly yet visibly in the top-left (Club Logo) and top-right (College Logo) corners, ensuring organizational branding is present without distracting from the timer.

Glassmorphism UI: All control panels and buttons implement a Glassmorphism (frosted glass) effect, using backdrop-blur and low opacity to give the UI a modern, floating, and dimensional appearance over the dark background.

Neon Glow Effect: The most critical text‚Äîthe title, the timer display, and the "TIME'S UP!" message‚Äîare rendered with a strong, pulsating red/crimson neon glow to make the time instantly recognizable and add a sense of foreboding.

‚è±Ô∏è Core Functionality
Advanced Time Setting: The dedicated "Set Time" control allows users to input the countdown duration using precise Hours, Minutes, and Seconds (HH:MM:SS) fields for complete control over the event length.

Dramatic Title Reveal: The application's title, "ENCRYPTED TRUTH," gradually reveals itself character-by-character as the timer runs down, using Framer Motion to sync the narrative directly with the event's progress.

Robust Controls: Includes clean, reliable buttons for Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset. The Reset button is specifically engineered to always return the countdown reliably to the last set starting time.

Audio and Utility: Features Mute/Unmute controls for the countdown tick and a dedicated Fullscreen toggle for optimal event projection.
